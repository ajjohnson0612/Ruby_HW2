STRING Tests :

    Palindrome tests:
        The first 3 tests of this file it is being used to make sure that all the different input 
        cases are acconted for including what the instructions were labeled, meaning that the 
        method should ignore the punctuation and capitalization in a word.

    Word Count Tests:
        Most of the tests for the word count deal with ignoring white space leading or embedded into the 
        input. While making sure instructions were followed on how the proplem should be solved using a 
        hash.

    Anagram Grouping Tests:
        The anagram grouping tests where the first ones that I ran into an issue with 
        the test not matching my output, to fix this i changed the test to check if the array that is 
        returned has everything that is needed. Whithout worrying about if its in the correct space or not
        
DESSERT tests :

    Dessert test :
        These tests were checking to see if the class Dessert was created and initialized correctly 
        checking to see if the method Delicious? was implemented and if the method tasty was implemented 
        
        The jelly bean tests made sure that the jelly bean class was a child of the Dessert class
        and made sure that the Jelly bean was named correctly and that you could access its variables 
        while making sure licorice is always terrible

Rock Paper Scissors testing(it was hell) :

    The tests for rock paper scissors are very scriaght forward, there were tests to make sure
    that the logic statements and what beats what was correct in the method. After that it got a 
    little more complicated, I did my functions slightly different and needed to eddit most of the 
    tests to pass in the correct number of parameters to my functions while still testing to see if the 
    recursion worked properly and if a simple game winner could be found
